I TAed CM 121 - Introduction to Bioinformatics for Harold, along with two other TAs. Topics included ranged from basic statistics topics like Maximum Likelihood, to RNA-seq normalization, to pseudoalignment, to dimension reduction and PCA. My responsibilities included writing \(1/3 of the\) lecture notes for discussion, giving discussion, grading, and responding to Piazza posts. If you're curious, you can view my discussion notes [here](http://localhost:4000/files/Discussion_1___Conditional_Probability.pdf), [here](http://localhost:4000/files/Discussion_3___RNA_seq_normalization_overview-3.pdf), and [here](http://localhost:4000/files/Discussion_4___pseudoalignment-1.pdf).
