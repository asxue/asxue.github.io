Hi! My name is Albert Xue, and I'm a PhD student at UCLA Bioinformatics working with [Harold Pimentel](https://pimentellab.com/) and [Sriram Sankararaman](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/lab.html). I develop statistical tools to understand gene regulation, genetic architecture and functional genomics. In my work, I try to make models with simple, strong, intuitive assumptions. I did my undergrad in Math and Computer Science at Duke.

I'm interested and actively looking for postdoc opportunities! My email is albertsxue [at] gmail [dot] com. Please reach out if you would like to work together, or just if you want to connect in general.

I enjoy writing and advocacy, and am trying to do more of both. Recently, I wrote a [piece about my friend's struggle with pancreatitis and the importance of science funding](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2025/07/070425-xue). This was part of the [McClintock Letters Initiative](https://blogs.cornell.edu/asap/events-initiatives/the-mcclintock-letters/). Hopefully one day this will merit its own section.
